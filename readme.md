# My Vim(Neovim) config
Please don't use this stinky config, it is not ready yet, and use it at your own risk!

You can go to my self explanatory init.vim to explore this configuration

## note for .vimrc stealer aka vim beginner out there
you can definitely steal it but I recommend to watching/read these good vim resources:
1. vimtutor in your own vim
2. mastering vim language: https://youtu.be/wlR5gYd6um0
3. maybe you don't need further plugins or config (especially from this stinky repo): https://youtu.be/XA2WjJbmmoM
